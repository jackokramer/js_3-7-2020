##Read two integers from STDIN and print three lines where:
##The first line contains the sum of the two numbers.
##The second line contains the difference of the two numbers (first - second).
## The third line contains the product of the two numbers.


a = 3
b = 2

first = a + b
second = a - b
third = a * b

print(first)
print(second)
print(third)
